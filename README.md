# Spelling Bee Solver

This project contains a script that scrapes the New York Times Spelling Bee puzzle data to extract the center letter, outer letters, and valid words for the game. It then uses a given word list to find acceptable words that meet the Spelling Bee criteria, comparing them with the valid words from the puzzle.
